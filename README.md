# Commutr

Commutr is an all around commuting application that combines desired features, which include the following:

1.	Trip Planner - This feature allows users to plan their trip accordingly, using any alerts or service changes to manage the most efficient way to arriving at a destination. The planner displays the fastest route to reaching a destination and a step by step directional guide. 
2.	Real Time Alerts - Using the MTA Real Time Data feeds, Commutr provides a constantly refreshing service where alert changes are checked and displayed. Users are able to view which train services are delayed and the direction bound of the delayed train. 
3.	Offline Maps- Offline maps are accessible by all users on the application, whether online or offline. It provides detailed routes of the NYC transit system. 
4.	Train Arrivals â€“ Commutr provides the functionality of viewing the arrival of trains at specific train stations, which are derived from the Static data feeds that the MTA provides. A user enters a station name and is presented with a list of trains going in both directions and their approximate arrival time.
5. 	Crowdfed Alerts (In Progress) - Following the Real Time Status Updates, this feature will also provide updates of service changes and delays along with other miscellaneous details, not from the MTA, but from everyday commuters. Using a Upvote/Downvote feature, users of the app will be able to drop pins on locations that have delays, sick customer, or service changes, which in turn other users will be able to alert near by commuters of this event by upvoting.
